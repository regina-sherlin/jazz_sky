# What is this project? 
  * This website is built for a fictional website as a design challenge from - [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef)
  * My task was to build the website as close to the design as possible. The designs were shared as figma assets and I had to translate it into a functioning website.
  * This project is special as this was my first ever challenge I took on in web development. It was to build this fully functioning tip-calculator with a unique design.
  
# What is it built with? 🏗️
  * It was built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript
 
# What have I learnt in the process? 🤸
  * I understood the problem statement deeply only in the process of developing.
  * I learnt about flexbox here. To divide sections and name them with BEM conventions.
 
 # Things to add in the future ⌚
 * Maybe add more functionality
